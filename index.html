      <div>
        <p>
          TechTogether Boston is a 2-day hackathon for people of marginalized
          genders hosted by community leaders across Massachusetts. The event
          will take place October 29-30th in the George Sherman Union at Boston
          University.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join us for two full days of skill-building and professional
          development workshops, networking with recruiters, and of course - fun
          activities like face masks. Each attendee has the option to work with
          a team to build a project like a website or mobile application with
          the support of our mentors. Whether it's your first hackathon or your
          100th, everyone has something to learn and contribute at this event!

              work alone, if you want to submit your project you must work with
              at least one other person. Don't worry if you don't have a
              team—you'll have plenty of opportunities to find one! TechTogether
